Made for first engagement with Caferiazi tweeter account problem in Matlab, Mathworks inc.

image pic1: first, hand method for solving the problem was asking if the "X" (known as a prize) is in which of the squares... Starting from the big one to the little one. but this method is out of the way so

... **I took my decision and code it in Matlab**

Matlab_Mathworks folder: this contains a *.m file from Matlab editor in which I wrote a code so that takes the matrix and make the question's needed matrix so you can perform actions to take out the "Prize"!

... **The problem is I don't know if it's alright!**
